# Player-Created Ladders

As a premium user, I want to create my own custom ladder tournament for an additional fee so that I can organize competitions among my friends or community with the same ranking and challenge system as official ladders.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can purchase ladder creation privilege via in-app payment (e.g., $5-10 one-time fee)
- [ ] Creation form collects: ladder name, description, max players, entry fee (optional), rules (customizable within limits)
- [ ] Created ladders integrate with existing ranking algorithm and challenge system
- [ ] Creator has admin privileges (invite players, moderate disputes, view analytics)
- [ ] Revenue sharing model implemented (platform takes percentage of entry fees)
- [ ] Ladders are discoverable but marked as "player-created" to differentiate from official ones

## Tasks

- [ ] Add payment integration (Stripe or in-app purchases)
- [ ] Design ladder creation UI with validation
- [ ] Update database schema for custom ladders
- [ ] Implement admin controls for ladder creators
- [ ] Add revenue tracking and sharing logic
- [ ] Update discovery/search to include player-created ladders
- [ ] Ensure same challenge and ranking flows apply
